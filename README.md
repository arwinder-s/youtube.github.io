Hey Developers, 

I have created this tool named to be as (youtube audio player)(v1.1).


#v1.0

Users can paste link of the youtube video and can listen to that audio for free, without the ads.

It also features controls for the player eg. play , pause btn's.


#v1.1 (current)

Minor bug fixes


#v1.2 (Expected May 2024)

Users will be able to slide to the desired part of the video

Based on their listening preferences, as youtube, it's gonna reccomend the videos to the user

More update on the way.

Bug fixes (if not, will create and then fix it)
